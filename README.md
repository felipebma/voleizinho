# Voleizinho

Voleizinho is a mobile application developed in Flutter for Android and IOS. This application aims to provide a tool for groups of friends who play volleyball, helping to balance teams based on the individual skills of each player in different volleyball fundamentals.

## Features

- **Group Creation**: Users can create different groups to manage players and matches separately.

- **Player Profile**: Each player added to a group will have a level in six volleyball fundamentals (Setting, Attack, Block, Reception, Movement, and Serve), mapped on a scale from 0 to 5 stars.

- **Fundamental Relevance**: Users can set a level of relevance for each of the fundamentals, allowing the calculation of the average level of each player's skills.

- **Team Selection**: Users can choose which players will participate in a match and define the number of players on each team.

- **Team Balancing**: The system automatically balances teams based on the weighted averages of each player's skills, creating teams as balanced as possible.

- **Team Sharing**: After team formation, users can share the team selections with the other players via WhatsApp.
